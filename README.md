# SpotifyEnhancer

Intro/Background:

Music today has become a staple of a user's daily lifestyle. Especially during the pandemic, music platforms have seen a great increase in subscriptions which shows how much people love their music [4]. Platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, and Soundcloud facilitate access to music have a recommendation system in place that isn’t completely transparent to the listener. For example when you play through a playlist on Spotify, songs which it deems similar to your playlist get played and it also provides recommended songs to add while creating a playlist. While we've been recommended great music on these platforms, there’s been times where we’ve been unsatisfied as well.

Specifically, we have trouble finding new songs because the current music recommendation systems recommend similar artists which tend to be quite popular. While there’s nothing wrong with recommending similar popular songs, it would be nice to get recommended new similar songs that we probably have not heard. Then, we thought it would be useful to create a model that predicts the genre of an input song.

Problem Statement:

We look to predict a song’s genre and recommend new songs from that genre or new closely related songs based on quantifiable features.
